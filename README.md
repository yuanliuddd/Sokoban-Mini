# Sokoban-Mini By Yuan L

Beginner's Coding Game at Ironhack

## Why I choose this game?
Classic old pixel game 
Good old Times lol

## Key features

- 100 Steps for each level
- Push the Heart to the Spot
- When all hearts are in position , you win 
- There are 7 Levels 
- Just in case you are not nerdy enough , there is a restart button for Cheating 
## What's next?

- Setup a local "Best Score" as the game is not linked to a database.
- Clean Code and try convert it to MVC
